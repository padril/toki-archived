# toki

This has been my second attempt to create a programming language. I think it went pretty good, definitely better than Sno. This is the first compiler I created, too. Overall, however, this project was mostly a learning experience and has enough errors to deserve a complete rewrite if I were to pick it up again, and as such, is now archived.

Toki pona is a minimalist art-lang created by linguist Sonja Lang. I absolutely love it, and thought that it's minimalist grammar would be suited to make a programming language sound like a natrual language. `toki` never became more than able to do a Hello World! but I think some of the ideas here are worth revisiting.
